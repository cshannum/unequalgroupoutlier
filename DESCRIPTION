Title: Anomaly Detection in Unequal Length Functional Data (Title Case)
Version: 0.3.1
Author: Caitlyn Hannum
Maintainer: Caitlyn Hannum <channum@mines.edu>
Description: This package provides tools for identifing anomalous behavior in
    group functional data. Functional data is fit using a mixed model with a 
    radial basis associated with the random coefficients. The estimated 
    coefficients are then put through a series of multivariate outlier detection 
    methods: PCA, Depth, t-SNE.
